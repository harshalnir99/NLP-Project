#The Problem:
Fake news has become an increasingly pervasive issue in our digital age. It spreads like wildfire, causing confusion, misinformation, and even harm to individuals and society at large.

#Solution:
I present to you my NLP project that leverages cutting-edge techniques to predict and flag potential fake news articles. By combining the power of NLP, machine learning, and deep learning, my goal is to make a positive impact in the fight against misinformation

#Technolgy Stack:-
For this project, I used the following libraries including:
Python  (for data preprocessing and modeling)
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) (for text processing and analysis)
TfidfVectorizer (for text feature extraction)
Logistic Regression (for building the final model)
